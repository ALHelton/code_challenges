# input: array of integers
# output: one integer

# NOTES
# The input array must have at least one number, less than 105
# the prices must be a positive number 
# assumption that prices must be a whole number
# Must find the difference between 2 numbers = profit
# number can only be considered for subtraction if it is 
# after the first number in the array order

# PSEUDOCODE
# need to iterate through the array of integers
# need to iterate again through the remaining numbers and compare 
# to the current element
# need a counter variable
# if the difference is more than 0, add to the counter variable
# if the counter variable number is higher than the difference, next
# return the counter variable number
