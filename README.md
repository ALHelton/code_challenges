<summary>  Millions of Numbers </summary>
<br>

You are given three arrays of equal size. Each array has 1 million RANDOM integer values.

Assume that each array is already sorted in ascending order and that no individual array has any duplicate values.

Your goal is to write a method/function that will return an array of any/all values which are present in all three arrays.

Bonus: Once youâ€™ve found a working solution, try to optimize to run in O(n) time and 1x space complexity.

Small Scale Example Below

<pre><code>
  nums_1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
  nums_2 = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
  nums_3 = [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
  find_matches(nums_1, nums_2, nums_3)
  => [2, 5]
</code></pre>

<summary>  Next Palindrome </summary>
<br>

A palindrome is any number, word, or phrase that reads the same forward as it does backward. In this challenge, we are going to focus on palindromic numbers. For example, 12321 is a palindromic number, whereas 123 is not.

Your goal is to write a method/function that takes in an integer and returns the next palindrome. It is safe to assume you are working with only whole numbers, no decimals, and no negatives.

Example

<pre><code>
  #Ruby
  find_next_palindrome(100)
  => 101

  find_next_palindrome(101)
  => 111


  #JavaScript
  findNextPalindrome(100)
  => 101

  findNextPalindrome(101)
  => 111
</code></pre>

<summary>  Recursive Function </summary>
<br>

Write or pseudocode a recursive function to calculate the sum of all of the positive whole numbers less than or equal to the input number

<summary>  Recursive 2 </summary>
<br>

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Examples

<pre><code>
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
</code></pre>

Constraints:

<pre><code>
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.
</code></pre>

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

<summary>  Flattener </summary>
<br>

Instructions

In Ruby and JavaScript, there is a built in method/function to flatten arrays, meaning it makes them one-dimensional. Below are examples of both Ruby and JavaScript:

Examples

<pre><code>
  #Ruby
  nums = [1, 2, 3, [[4], 5], [[[6]]]]
  nums.flatten
  => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

  #JavaScript
  var nums = [ 0, 1, 2, [ 3, 4 ] ]
  nums.flat()
  => [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
</code></pre>

Your goal is to recreate this functionality without using the built in method/function. You will be given a deeply nested array, or multi-dimensional array, that will look similar to either of the below:

<pre><code>
  nums = [1, 2, 3, [[4], 5], [[[6]]]]
  words = ["hi", "this is", [[["string"], "that is very"], [[[["nested"]]]]]]
</code></pre>

The contents of the array are not significant. Your method/function should take an input of a multi-dimensional array and output a one-dimensional array. More simply put, remove the deeply nested brackets to return a single array.

<summary>  Valid Anagram </summary>
<br>

Instructions

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Examples

Example 1:

<pre><code>
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
</code></pre>

Example 2:

<pre><code>
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
</code></pre>

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

My answer: By splitting all characters and then tallying each, it encompasses this edge case
